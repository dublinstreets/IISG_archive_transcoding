# First Trajectory of the Project
<h3>The Initial Mindmap</h3>

obsessive collecting of objects in space / ordering and labelling of objects > it is a to compensate the mental emptiness and loneliness / solitude > also to isolate the Self and push the autonomy and independence of the Self, as it feels natural, it is a path > it is a patterned way of interaction with the surroundings, a particular strategy of an individual > on one side - independence and autonomy of Self in relation to the outer world & on another side - traces on loneliness / solitude are to be evident sooner or later 

<h3>Topic - Autonomous and / vs / yet Lonely Individual</h3>

# Research on Artefact
<h3>Jasper Robert Grootveld</h3>
<br>- Dutch Artist, 19 July 1932 – 26 February 2009</br>
<br>- Born in Amsterdam</br>
<br>- Had a specific philosophy regarding how the masses are brainwashed to become addicted consumers</br>
<br>- Robert Jasper Grootveld is one of the defining figures in post-war Dutch history</br>
<br>- A man from the street who therefore fell outside all existing frameworks, but with his unique performances he eventually broke them open one by one</br>
<br>- Around the age of eighteen he is deeply unhappy and he is admitted to a psychiatric hospital for observation</br>
<br>- In the fifties he maintains, looking for attention, a whole series of homosexual relationships with men who are not only a lot older than him, but who seem to have had a much better life, including a banker, a television reporter , a (hurried) priest, a poet, a harbor baron, a real estate trader and a (popular) writer</br>
<br>- Marijuana entered his life in the early 1960s. He also stops his homosexual contacts. It seems as if he is putting someone else in his place, who will not let him go for the rest of his life: Sinterklaas</br>
<br>- He attacks the cigarette industry that manipulates people through advertising and blinded the dangers of smoking. In the fall of 1961, he began to paint cigarette advertising posters with 'cancer' or with a k</br>
<br>- In 2007, his raft fleet is moored for the International Institute of Social History. RJG withdraws to a care home in Amsterdam</br>

# Research Questions
<br>- Research Question #0: What defines a culture of online self-sufficiency?</br>
<br>-Research Question #1 (main):What strategies does the culture of online self-sufficiency use?</br>

# Transcodings
Please include a general description of the role of transcoding in your project. Using the H2 headings below, you can specify individual Transcoding experiments. Think about your motivations in transcoding, and mention the role of tools (also those made during the assignment). This gives some direction to the reader about what they will read in more detail below. 

## Transcoding No. 1
### Description
Short description here. You can structure the information and documentation for each transcoding, design research or coding tool as you like. It's important that you make clear the aims & goals of the transcoding, what methods and tools you use. If this is often the same across different transcodings, consider making a standardised table at the beginning of each.

You should include well-formatted documentation of your experiments and developments below. Someone without previous knowledge about your work should be able to follow along the steps, aims and results of your developments from this structure. Make sure all media used is correctly linked or embedded (images, PDFs, Videos, etc). 

### Methods
Description of your methods, documentation of behind-the-scenes processes can go here. Think of the photos and videos you made when visiting the IISG or during captures of your artefact. You can use tools such as [Gifs.com](https://gifs.com/) to generate moving-image thumbnail to link to short videos.Just enough to give a clear overview, before getting into details.  

With some HTML tags you can do simple styling in markdown, for example:

    <width="50%">
[<img src="https://j.gifs.com/ROJr3z.gif" width="50%">](https://youtu.be/o2rmmqxC4NU)

Remember to include the url link to jump to the full media, of course! 


### Tools 
Mention the tools that you used or made (if and when relevant). 

### Results
Some of your transcoding experiments may have smaller outcome sketches like images or short video tests. They can go directly within this section. Or maybe this transcoding became a part of the final outcome format. When that is the case, you can simply include a [hyperlink](#) to the final outcomes in the **Transcoding** section. In the final outcome section below you can embed or explain the final format outcome in detail.  

## Transcoding Tool 
### Description
You might have made multiple coding tools during the semester. Or the transcoding tool might be part of a specific transcoding experiment itself. It's up to you to define the linear flow of the Readme. Just like the transcoding of media itself, the coding tool should be well documented. So if you are using a coding tool in your first experiment, include the documentation of the coding tool **before** you include the results, etc. 

### Aims
Include the main aims or intentions behind making the tool, and what it is used for. 

### Methods
This includes the coding languages, coding frameworks or libraries, and any platforms or webtools for example.   

### Results
The coding tool will vary a lot between different students. So depending on the use and type, you may include more or less documentation here. 

### Source Links
Please include links to the tools, sources etc used during the coding. E.g. the resources used for making your coding tool.  
 

# Reflection
You might want to include a section about reflecting on the results of your coding and IMD experiments this semester. It can give additional context before reading the final outcomes below. 

# Outcomes
This section will be different for each student, depending on how and what is formatted as a final result for the semester assignment. Nevertheless a clear written and documented outcomes is important. So give the appropriate subsections or formats to make this as thorough as possible. 

### Outcome Links
Here you link to your final assignment outcomes. This could be a website, a video, etc etc. Please include links to the appropriate GitHub folder on your repository where your coding tool is stored. 

This is the main way to access your IMD + Coding outcomes for the semester. So its very important that you check for bugs, troubleshoot hyperlink issues, embedded media issues etc. Please make sure you KNOW where each file you use is stored. E.g. If you migrated from Notion markdown into GitHub, its **VERY IMPORTANT** to know that Notion randomly stores images on an Amazon server. It changes those locations all the time. So if your main outcome or documentation is still grabbing those links, **its very likely** they might disappear before collectives. So please have all media and necessary files managed well in your own locations (online or github etc).   

# Conclusion 
You might have a nice conclusive observation to share at the end :)

## List of Feedbacks
<h3>From Martijn as of March 16th</h3>
<br>- digital realm, how can you be self-sufficient online, that means you don't use Google services, email and you need to set up your own?</br>
<br>- digital counterpart for the topics/articles in the issues</br>
<br>- the Whole Earth catalogue</br>
<br>- define a research question</br>
<br>- what are analogue strategies to transcode an artefact?</br>
<br>- what are the digital tools to transcode an artefact?</br>

<h3>From Hannes as of March 23rd</h3>
<br>- about the artefact: 1 way is transcoding the content of an artefact / 2 way is transcoding the context of an artefact</br>
<br>- about the transcoding: think of shapes for coming transcodings and quickly go for it, it can be rough</br>
<br>- about the transcoding: what is lost and what is gained during transcoding</br>
<br>- about the transcoding: what kind of things you'd like to make</br>
<br>- about readme. file: readme. file is one to present to the public, cleaned and refined one</br>
<br>- about readme. file: images can be either embedded links</br>
<br>- about readme. file: make a personal google drive, collect images there for notion</br>

<h3>From Martijn as of March 30th</h3>
<br>- create and maintain my own server</br>
<br>- how to make a self-sufficient video?</br>
<br>- open source community</br>
<br>- manifesto in 3 different mediums</br>
<br>- 3 different manifesto in 1 medium</br>
<br>- what elements define my existence online? e.g last time seen online, public IP address, internet provider, internet speed</br>
<br>- possible to set up own wifi network</br>

<h3>From Hannes as of April 8th</h3>
<br>- podcast to listen to (https://www.e-flux.com/podcasts/df2a7f44638448ac89e8c84f6ae322fe/extern)</br>
<br>- there should be 1 coding tool in the project</br>
<br>- subtitles are also a matter that can be designed</br>
<br>- be critical of a format, because it is already a relatively big text</br>
<br>- digital and practical self-sufficiency already co-exist online — > there is no need to invent (a sort of culture in my case) — > work with the 'raw' original text</br>
<br>- this original text of a publisher asks for a performative aspect</br>
<br>- this original text can be transcoded in 2/3 different mediums:</br>
    - make a reading, so audio medium</br>
    - make a video with visuals, so image medium</br>

 <h3>From Hannes and Martijn as of April 20th</h3>
<br>- there is already one concrete outcome — the collective [read.me](http://read.me) catalogue ('The Catalogue of Resillience')</br>
<br>- the approach to structure the catalogue is editorial</br>
<br>- week May 11-16 is when the [read.me](http://read.me) file should be final</br>
<br>- when defining the format of the transcoding, think as if it should actually replace the artefact in the IISG</br>
<br>- articles from the issue can be transcoded into video tutorials</br>
<br> - think of the following scheme: 1) pick one issue of the periodical — > 2) transcode the content into a digital publication aka the website — > 3) embed the links / references of how the community of self-sufficientcy functions now</br>
<br>- in a way, i have to be the contemporary designer of the old issue</br>
<br>- have a preliminary version of the website by May 4th</br>
