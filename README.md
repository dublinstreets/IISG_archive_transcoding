# Artefact
Serials 'Practical Self-Sufficiency' is an Artefact that created an Aura by communicating a globally known movement of Self-Sufficient living. Speicifically originating in England in 1970s, the Artefact was willing to unite people in Self-Sufficient Living endeavours and promote this way of living to a wider audience.

# Transcodings
The main aim of the transcodings is activation of the content inside the issue by giving it is some visual / acoustic dynamic. The first transcoding activates the text from the publisher via transcoding of the text into video and sound. The rest of the content is text and image based and has a tutorial / instruction like character. Thus, the variety of it is transcoded into a website. 

# Transcoding No. 1
### Description
**The transcoding is based on the text from the publiser, found in issue No.1 dating November / December 1975**

<img src="https://github.com/sonianikolaeva/IISG_archive_transcoding/blob/master/Documentation/img/text_from_the_publisher.png" width="30%">

**Here is the text:**
*This magazine has come into being because there is a need for it. The country faces grave economic difficulties and the likelihood of severe shortages. Rapid inflation, unemployment, soaring food prices, chemically adulterated foods and the increasing dehumanising of our Society, have all contributed to a growing awareness of the need to be more self-reliant — to grow more of our own food — to make less demands on a welfare state which can no longer cope with the needs of its citizens. 
There is no shortage of writings which comment on the present state of society, or of theoretical suggestions for its improvement. We are steeped in a plethora of words — a situation which leaves the thinking and concerned person in a state of frustration. The need is for direct experience of the whole and natural life, irrespective of the situation in which we find ourselves — whether it be in the centre of a city or in a commune in Wales. This is of paramount importance, not only for us, but for our children — for knowledge and experience gained in childhood are never lost.This is primarily a practical magazine where we shall seek to rediscover and pass on knowledge of traditional skills and practices of good husbandry and craftsmanship. Much of this 'small-scale' knowledge is in danger of dying out —so accustomed have we become to having everything 'laid on' for us. In order to do this we need your help in the form of letters, suggestions, advice and contributions from your experience. In this respect, we particularly welcome the subscribers to 'Self-Reliance Newsletter' — a publication launched just over a year ago by Colin Richardson, and which is now an integral part of 'Practical Self-Sufficiency'. SRN readers have spearheaded the movement towards pooling know-ledge and experience of small-scale living. 
We are not out to make a profit — every subscription will go towards expanding and improving the publication. We shall make many mistakes initially, and hope that you will bear with us — we are also learning. The need now is for a concerted effort, already begun, to harness the pragmatic genius and innovative ability of this nation — it is to this end that 'Practical Self-Sufficiency' is directed.* 

**Why this text is important:**
The text is an entry point into the global topic of Self-Sufficient Living that the periodicals are adressing. More in detail, the text speculates about why there is a need for an individual to transfer to Self-Sufficient Living and encourages the reader to do so by bulding up a community via those printed issues.

### Methods
**1. Pure Audio**

The first transcoding I have made is a the *reading* of the *text from a publisher*. However, since it is a *relatively big text*, purely audio format might not be the the best one to deliver the info to the listener to the full extend. However, it was *a useful step* to understand that the reading does need a *visual side to it*.

**To listen to the reading go to:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4yGQXLIQZM

**2. Moving image + subtitles**

*Firstly*, I was thinking about having a black screen and running subtitles, while the audio is still present there. So the person could not only use the verbal memory, but also visual memory to digest the content.

**Sketch 1:**

<img src="https://github.com/sonianikolaeva/IISG_archive_transcoding/blob/master/Documentation/img/transcoding_still_image.jpg" width="55%">

*Secondly*, I understood that the black screen is obviously not the best option for a video that's running 3.5 minites. Then I started to experient with recording myself as a text activator and manipulation the image of myself to have it more abstarct. Indeed, the personality of me is not imporant, but its important to see that behind the activation there is a real person.

# Transcoding No. 2
### Description
**As a way to address the very relevant status of the movement in the current times, there is the website that serves as a platform. The idea of this plaform is to refer to the Artefact of the IISG is 2 ways. One is visual way - the platform uses a similar layout design as the cover in the original magazine. One the contextual way - it presents the original articles with illustrations from one of the issues of the magazine. Another layer of the platform is referencial. It is possible to dive into tips / tutorials of Self-Sufficient Living that people share these times.**

# Transcoding Tool

### Description
The main tool of the prococess is digital - turning the content that originally exists in a printed matter into a webformat. Thus the main tool is coding - the website that collides together the original content of the magazine and links to the tips of Self-Sufficient living of the current times.  

### Aims
**1. Video** The main aim of the video is to activate the text from the publisher and add a visual layer it to - so that the person who watches uses his/her visual memory to digest the text.

**2. Audio** The main aim of the audio is to activate the text. However, this format has a more experimental nature as it appeared to be less perspective. The consuming of quite a long text isn't that easy and smooth with an audio format.

**3. Website** The main aim of the website is to bring the original printed content of the isuues into a digital dimention. As the same time, this way the this content could be merged with a contemporary tips of Self-Sufficient living. 

### Methods
**1. Video** - exists online on YouTube and is implemented on the website;

**3. Audio** -  exists online on YouTube;

**3. Website** -  exists onlne and is published via GitHub;
 
# Reflection
Generally, approaching the Artefact from a standpoint of a person, who 'activates' the content inside worked well for me. In that way, I could both analyse and dive into the content, which communicates a topic that's personally interesting for me. At the same time, I could have a room for creative experimentation and learning of the digital tools such as video editing and webcoding. However, limited (or more fairly none) access to the Artefact due to health crisis of Covid-19 was quite an obstacle. The project would be much more in-depth if I could get back to my Artefact, which, I have to point of, consists of quite a big volume of issues. I would benefit a lot from analysing a bigger scope of magazine issues. 

# Outcome
**1**. Outcome 1 presents the text from the publisher in an audio and video formats.

**2**. Outcome 2 presents a website, which drawns a parallel between the movement of Self-Sufficient Living back then (in 1970s) and now. It communicates the idea that the movement is still relevant today and that the suggestions / tutorials / tips  for Self-Sufficient Living come together from different times in spite of tecnhological developments and globalization.

# Conclusion
Regarding working with the method of transcoding, I have learned to look at the tools and visual ways of communcation in a broader way. At first, the idea of transcoding one medium into another seemed very vague and unclear, but later on the scope of possibilies become quite broad.
Regarding the theme / movement I worked with, I was happy to be able to chose an Artefact that's personally interesting for me. I enjoyed the research phase and expecially looking for parallels and common points in the movement that was popular 40 years ago and still remains so. It is indeed unfortunate that I didn't have access to the Artefact due to Covid-19. In fact, after my first visit to IISG, I wasn't sure this Artefact would be my final one and planned to come back and search more. Thus at that moment I didn't make a good documentation of the Artefact (e.g scans) and so it wasn't that smooth of a process to work only with a few pictures of the magazine spreads. The Artefact is not available anywhere else online or as a pdf.
