# Artefact
Serials 'Practical Self-Sufficiency' is an Artefact that created an Aura by communicating a globally known movement of Self-Sufficient living. Speicifically originating in England in 1970s, the Artefact was willing to unite people in Self-Sufficient Living endeavours and promote this way of living to a wider audience.

# Research Questions
<br>- Research Question #0: What defines a culture of online self-sufficiency?</br>
<br>-Research Question #1 (main):What strategies does the culture of online self-sufficiency use?</br>

# Transcodings
The main aim of each individual transcoding is to 'activate' the content inside of a chosen issue. The content is text and image based and has a tutorial / instruction like character. So with the individual transcodings I aim to give the content some dynamic with the format of an auido / video, but also to to make it some visual for people who will be diving into it.  

## Transcoding No. 1_Sketch
### Description
<br>The transcoding is based on the text from the publiser, found in issue No.1 dating November / December 1975.</br>
<img src="Documentation/img/text_from_the_publisher.png" width="50%">
<br>The text is an entry point into the global topic of Self-Sufficient Living that the periodicals are adressing. More in detail, the text speculates about why there is a need for an individual to transfer to Self-Sufficient Living and encourages the reader to do so by bulding up a community via those printed issues.</br>

### Methods

<br>1. Audio</br>
<br>To listen to the reading: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4yGQXLIQZM</br>
<br>However, since it is a relatively big text, purely audio format might not be the the best one to deliver the info to the listener to the full extend</br>
<br>2. Audio + Subtitles + Static Image</br>
